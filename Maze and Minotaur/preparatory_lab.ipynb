    "\n",
    "We propose the following MDP formulation: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### State space $\\mathcal{S}$\n",
    "We model the state space as the set of all possible positions of the player in the maze. Note that we exclude the obstacles' position since these are impossible states to be in for the player. Formally, the state space is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{S} = \\big\\lbrace (i,j):\\textrm{such that the cell\n",
    "} (i,j) \\textrm{ is not an obstacle}\\big\\rbrace.$$\n",
    "> **Note:** The choice of state space is not unique. For instance one could consider $\\mathcal{S}$ to be the set of all positions in the  maze regardless of whether they correspond to an obstacle or not. But note that, this will increase the size $\\vert \\mathcal{S} \\vert $. This is fine for small mazes, but it leads to many redundant states as the maze dimension increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action space $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "We allow the player to chose to either move `left`, `right`, `down`, `up` or not move at all (`stay`). Note that sometimes the player cannot move in a certain direction because of an obstacle or a wall, yet we permit this to be action. We will see that this is not an issue as long as we define our transition probabilities and rewards appropriately.\n",
    "Formally, the action space is\n",

    "> **Note:** Once again, the choice of the action space is not unique. For instance one could remove the action `stay` from $\\mathcal{A}$, but then one should modify the transition probabilities accordingly as well as the rewards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transition probabilities $\\mathcal{P}$\n",

    "- If at state (or position)  $s$ taking action (or move) $a$ leads to a wall or an obstacle, the player remains in his state (or position) $s$, then $\\mathbb{P}(s \\vert s, a) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Recall that for a fixed $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ we have $\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mathbb{P}(s' \\vert s, a) = 1$, thus if for some $s' \\in \\mathcal{S}$  we have $\\mathbb{P}(s' \\vert s, a) = 1$, then for all $s'' \\in \\mathcal{S} \\backslash \\lbrace s'\\rbrace$ we have $\\mathbb{P}(s'' \\vert s, a) = 0$,\n",

    "> **Note**: Here the rewards are independent of time (i.e. $r_t(.,.) = r(.,.)$). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "The above MDP formulation is implemented as a class ``maze.Maze`` in the file [maze.py](./maze.py) which given a matrix description of the maze instanciates the state space, action space, transition probabilities and rewards. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In the class `maze.Maze` each state $s = (i,j)$ is given a unique identifier $s_{id} \\in \\lbrace 0, , \\dots, \\vert S \\vert -1 \\rbrace$. In other words, the state space from an implementation perspective is viewed as the set of integers $\\lbrace 0, , \\dots, \\vert S \\vert -1 \\rbrace$. This mapping is done via the dictionary `self.map` and its inverse mapping via the dictionary `self.states`.   "
